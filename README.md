## Understanding YubiKeys

### What Is a YubiKey? ü§î

A **YubiKey** is a compact hardware security module that supports several authentication methods, including:
- **FIDO2 / WebAuthn:** For passwordless login and two-factor authentication.
- **Smart Card (PIV):** Used for certificate-based logins on Windows, macOS, and SSH.
- **OpenPGP:** For GPG encryption, email signing, and Git commit signing.
- **OTP (TOTP/HOTP):** To replace mobile authenticators like Google Authenticator.
- **Challenge-Response:** For securing applications like LUKS full disk encryption and KeepassXC.

### Cryptographic Foundations üîí

The security of a YubiKey is underpinned by robust cryptographic algorithms:

| Feature               | Algorithms                        | Use Case                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **FIDO2 / U2F**       | ECC (P-256, P-384), RSA-2048       | Passwordless login and 2FA                   |
| **PIV (Smart Card)**  | RSA-2048, ECC (P-256, P-384)       | Secure SSH and Windows/macOS logins          |
| **OpenPGP**           | RSA-4096, ECC                     | Email encryption, Git signing, SSH           |
| **TOTP/HOTP**         | HMAC-SHA1 (RFC 4226/6238)         | Time-based or counter-based one-time codes     |
| **Challenge-Response**| HMAC-SHA1                         | Applications like LUKS and KeepassXC         |
| **Yubico OTP**        | AES-128 Challenge-Response        | Legacy OTP authentication                    |

## Core YubiKey Features & Real-World Usage

### FIDO2 / WebAuthn ‚Äì Passwordless & 2FA üåê

**Overview:**  
FIDO2 allows you to log in without a password by using public-key cryptography. The YubiKey generates a key pair where the public key is registered with the service and the private key is securely stored on the device.

**Real-World Setup on Arch Linux:**

```sh
sudo pacman -S libfido2
fido2-token -L
```

**Supported Services:**  
Google, Microsoft, GitHub, GitLab, Bitwarden, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox

---

### Smart Card (PIV) for Secure Logins üñ•Ô∏è

**Overview:**  
Use your YubiKey as a hardware smart card for secure SSH, Windows, or macOS logins. The private keys are stored in the secure chip, never written to disk.

**Example ‚Äì SSH Authentication on Arch Linux:**

```sh
sudo pacman -S yubikey-manager
ykman piv keys generate 9a pubkey.pem
```

Then, add the public key to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

---

### OpenPGP for Encryption, Signing & SSH ‚úâÔ∏è

**Overview:**  
YubiKey‚Äôs OpenPGP mode keeps your private GPG keys secure on the device, allowing you to sign emails, commits, and even use SSH authentication.

**Example ‚Äì Git Signing Setup on Arch Linux:**

```sh
sudo pacman -S gnupg yubikey-manager
gpg --card-edit
# In the interactive prompt:
# admin
# keytocard
```

Configure Git:

```sh
git config --global user.signingkey <GPG_KEY_ID>
git commit -S -m "Signed commit"
```

---

### OTP: TOTP/HOTP as Authenticator Replacement ‚è±Ô∏è

**Overview:**  
Replace mobile authenticators by storing TOTP/HOTP secrets on your YubiKey.

**Example ‚Äì Adding a TOTP Account on Arch Linux:**

```sh
sudo pacman -S yubikey-manager
ykman oath accounts add google --secret <BASE32_SECRET>
ykman oath code google
```

Mobile users can use the Yubico Authenticator app (available for Android and iOS).

---

### Challenge-Response for LUKS and KeepassXC üîë

**Overview:**  
Use the YubiKey to generate a challenge-response hash for unlocking encrypted disks (LUKS) or accessing password managers (KeepassXC).

**Example ‚Äì Setting Up for KeepassXC on Arch Linux:**

```sh
ykman otp chalresp --touch --generate 2
```

Then, configure KeepassXC to use YubiKey challenge-response by selecting the appropriate slot.

---

## Advanced Configurations & Security Considerations

### Static Password on Touch (HID Mode) ‚å®Ô∏è

**Overview:**  
Program your YubiKey to emulate a USB keyboard that types a stored static password when touched. This is useful for legacy systems.

**Configuration Example on Arch Linux:**

```sh
ykman otp static --keyboard-layout us 1
# When prompted, enter your custom static password.
```

Generate a random 32-character password for the second slot:

```sh
ykman otp static --generate 2 --length 32
```

**Security Note:**  
Combine with a manually typed prefix to mitigate keylogger risks.

---

### Using YubiKey for Full Disk Encryption (LUKS) üíΩ

**Overview:**  
Bind your LUKS passphrase with YubiKey challenge-response so that unlocking the disk requires both the YubiKey and a passphrase.

**Configuration on Arch Linux:**

1. Set up challenge-response on Slot 2:

    ```sh
    ykman otp chalresp --touch --generate 2
    ```

2. Configure LUKS to use the YubiKey (for example, using a tool like `ykfde-enroll`):

    ```sh
    ykfde-enroll /dev/sdX
    ```

---

### Enabling PIN and Touch Policies üîê

Enhance security by requiring physical touch or a PIN before use.

- **FIDO2 PIN Change:**

  ```sh
  ykman fido access change-pin
  ```

- **Set Touch Requirement for OpenPGP:**

  ```sh
  ykman openpgp keys set-touch aut on
  ```

- **Require Touch for PIV (Smart Card) Authentication:**

  ```sh
  ykman piv set-touch-policy 9a always
  ```

---

### Troubleshooting & Maintenance üõ†Ô∏è

**Resetting YubiKey Components:**

- **Factory Reset (All Data Erased):**

  ```sh
  ykman reset
  ```

- **Reset PIV Module:**

  ```sh
  ykman piv reset
  ```

- **Reset FIDO2 Module:**

  ```sh
  ykman fido reset
  ```

- **Reset OTP Slots:**

  ```sh
  ykman otp delete 1
  ykman otp delete 2
  ```

**If GPG does not detect your YubiKey:**

```sh
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
gpg --card-status
```

For connectivity issues on Arch Linux, check system logs:

```sh
journalctl -u systemd-udevd | grep -i yubikey
```

---

## Backup, Duplication & Recovery üíæ

**Why Backup?**  
Relying on a single YubiKey poses a risk. Duplicate configurations for PIV, OpenPGP, TOTP, and Challenge-Response to prevent account lockouts.

**Duplication Strategies:**

- **FIDO2:** Cannot be duplicated; register multiple keys with your accounts.
- **PIV (Smart Card):** Generate and import identical keys across multiple YubiKeys.
- **OpenPGP:** Export and import your secret key and move it to additional devices.
- **TOTP:** Manually add the same secret to multiple YubiKeys.
- **Challenge-Response:** Copy the generated secret between devices.

**Resetting Individual Components:**

- **OpenPGP Reset:**

  ```sh
  ykman openpgp reset
  ```

- **PIV Reset:**

  ```sh
  ykman piv reset
  ```

- **FIDO2 Reset:**

  ```sh
  ykman fido reset
  ```

---

## Practical Implementations with Real Services üåç

**FIDO2 / WebAuthn for Websites:**

- **Setup:**  
  Register your YubiKey as a security key in your account‚Äôs security settings (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.).
  
- **Mobile Usage:**  
  Android (via NFC or USB-C) and iPhone (Lightning port or NFC) support YubiKey authentication.

**Smart Card (PIV) for Windows and SSH:**

- **Windows Login Example:**

  ```sh
  # On Arch Linux, use YubiKey Manager to generate a key:
  ykman piv keys generate 9a pubkey.pem
  ```

  Import the generated certificate into Windows via MMC and enable Smart Card Login.

**OpenPGP for Email and Git:**

- Follow the GPG setup and then configure your email client or Git to use the YubiKey-stored keys.

**TOTP for Two-Factor Authentication:**

- Add your service‚Äôs TOTP secret to the YubiKey using:

  ```sh
  ykman oath accounts add <service> --secret <BASE32_SECRET>
  ```

**Challenge-Response for KeepassXC and LUKS:**

- Configure your password manager or disk encryption tool to use the response from your YubiKey.

## Enterprise Deployment & Custom Integrations üè¢

For businesses and advanced users, YubiKey can be deployed at scale for robust enterprise security.

### Multi-User Provisioning

- **Bulk Enrollment:**  
  Use scripts to pre-configure YubiKeys with static passwords, PIV keys, and OTP settings.
  
  ```sh
  # Example enrollment snippet:
  ykman otp static --generate 1 --length 32
  ykman piv keys generate -a RSA2048 9a public.pem
  ykman piv certificates generate --subject "CN=UserName" 9a public.pem
  ```

- **Active Directory Integration:**  
  Enforce smart card authentication via Group Policy. Import YubiKey certificates for each user.

  **Useful Link:**

### VPN and Cloud Authentication

- **VPN:**  
  Configure OpenVPN to use PKCS#11 with YubiKey for secure remote access.

  ```sh
  sudo pacman -S openvpn opensc
  openvpn --show-pkcs11-ids /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
  ```

  Edit your OpenVPN config accordingly.

- **Cloud Services:**  
  Enable YubiKey-based MFA for AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure through their respective security settings.

### Custom Scripting and Automation

Automate routine authentication tasks and workflows using shell scripts. For example, auto-copy an OTP to the clipboard upon YubiKey insertion:

```sh
echo 'ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0407", RUN+="/usr/bin/ykman otp code 1 | xclip -selection clipboard"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-yubikey.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

---

## Automation & Scripting for High-Security Workflows ü§ñ

Enterprise users can integrate YubiKey operations into CI/CD pipelines, secure API requests, and automated SSH logins.

- **SSH Automation:**  
  Generate a resident FIDO2 SSH key:

  ```sh
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -O verify-required -f ~/.ssh/id_yubikey
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_yubikey.pub user@server.com
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
  ssh user@server.com
  ```

- **API Authentication:**  
  Replace API keys with YubiKey-based signatures to protect sensitive operations.

- **Enterprise Scripting:**  
  Develop custom scripts to manage bulk provisioning, key rotation, and automated failover in multi-user environments.
